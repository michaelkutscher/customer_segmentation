# customer_segmentation
This repository contains an exemplary customer segmentation for a food retailer.
It was made for my bachelor thesis with the title: 
"Big Data Analytics und Machine Learning: MÃ¶glichkeiten und Grenzen datenbasierter Kundenzentrierung als Wettbewerbsfaktor im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel".

The customer segmentation was used to support the idea of the CRISP-DM workflow in data analytics. The food retailer shall be able to segment it's customers based on their similarities among each other. The segmentation shall increase the overall effectiveness of the food retailer through avoiding scattering losses in the customer approach while increasing the revenue thanks to precisely targeted marketing activites. Please note, that the data set is generated on the fly to assure reproducibility for the reader of the thesis.
